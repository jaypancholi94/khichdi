#### who said tech setups can't be fun? 😉

## 🏆 Developer's must have application
These are the application which I use the most and can't live without it
1. [[Terminal]]
2. [[VS Code]]
3. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) - Don't know git commands? don't worry just download the GitHub Desktop Client and it will manage commands underneath 😛 
## 🔧 Productivity Tool
Found out about these ones searching 
1. [[Obsidian]] - THE BEST markdown editor in the market and its FREEEEEE!
2. [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) - To-Do list app. It's a trap ⚠️, if you purchase one application, you will end up buying all 😝
	- Mac - US $49.99 (Free Trial Available)
	- iPhone & Watch - US $9.99
	- iPad - US $19.99
3. [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com) - Move and resize windows in macOS, if you are fan of not touching mouse 😉
4. [Alfred 5](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - In simple words, Alfred is the best replacement of spotlight search, we perform using `cmd + space`
5. [Arc Browser](https://arc.net) - Try once and you will never go back to Chrome
6. [Cheatsheet](https://www.mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet) - If you like shortcut as I do, but can't remember? Don't worry. Cheatsheet will show you all the shortcuts for current focused window/app. Just press and hold `cmd`
## 🛡️ Security
I prefer 1Password over BitWarden, but here is a quick comparison
### [1Password](https://1password.com)
#### Pros 👍🏻
1. Excellent user interface and design across devices
2. Comprehensive set of features
3. Strong security features including Travel Mode
4. Watch Tower
5. Family and team plans for sharing passwords
#### Cons 👎🏻
1. Expensive than BitWarden
2. Closed-source

### [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com)
#### Pros 👍🏻
1. Open-source and transparent
2. Free tier available
#### Cons 👎🏻
1. User Interface is not polish, and auto save or auto fill will not work as expected
2. Limited customer support for free tier
3. Less built-in features compare to 1Password

### Conclusion
Remember that the choice between BitWarden and 1Password depends on your specific needs, preferences, and budget. Both are capable password managers, but BitWarden leans more towards affordability and open-source principles, while 1Password offers a more polished experience with a wider range of features but at a higher cost.
