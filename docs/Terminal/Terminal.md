# Terminal: The Dev's Not-So-Secret Love Affair 😂
Ah, the terminal - that quirky, old-school friend of developers! 🤓 It's like a time machine to the '80s, but trust me, it's not just for nostalgia. This bad boy handles coding, project juggling, and even unleashes our inner script-magicians. 🧙‍♂️ It's like the ultimate multitool, and who doesn't love feeling like a command-line superhero? 🦸‍♂️ Stick around, and we'll unveil all the secrets of this retro-cool, text-based wizardry! 😎🚀

## 💻 List of terminals

Terminal that I have used in past

1. Terminal (Built-in): Let's face it, we all know about it. Simple not so fancy. But hey, it gets the job done
2. [iTerm2](#iterm2) - Most customisable terminal in the market. Just imagine built-in terminal on steroid 💊
3. [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/): Terminal with ai power

## 🐚 shell

in a nutshell, the shell is your coding maestro, while the terminal is the messenger boy, shuttling your commands to and fro. They're a dynamic duo, working together to bring your code to life, even if they sometimes give you a bewildered look when you're not clear about what you want. 🧙‍♂️🍽️

**Zsh (Z Shell)**: It's like the upgraded sibling of Bash. It's like Bash's suave alter ego, with advanced auto-completion and syntax highlighting in its bag of tricks.

**Oh My Zsh**: picture Oh My Zsh as the personal stylist for Zsh, transforming it from a casual dresser to a fashion icon. With an array of plugins and themes, it's like giving Zsh a makeover, turning it into the dazzling star of the shell realm.

## iTerm2

iTerm2 is my current Not-So-Secret Love Affair. ❤️
Download iTerm2 from [here](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html) and Install it.

### Setup to look more appealing

If you prefer minimalist design you should configure iTerm2 as I did

1. Open iTerms2 preferences. `cmd + ,`
2. Go To `Appearance`
	- Set Theme to `Compact`
	- Tab bar location to `Top`
	- Status bar location to `Bottom`

3. Go to `Profiles` and create new profile clicking `+`

I am using `Snazzy` as colour scheme, [here you can explore more schemes](https://iterm2colorschemes.com/)
