**Navigating Panes**: Move between panes using `Ctrl-b` and arrow keys. However, I am using [[Vim]] for my default editor, I have rebind it to `h`, `j`, `k`, & `l` in my [config](https://github.com/jaypancholi94/configs/blob/main/tmux/.tmux.conf).

**Customising tmux**: Edit `~/.tmux.conf` to add custom key bindings, colours, and more. 🎨

**Using Plugins**: Enhance tmux with plugins like `tmux-resurrect` for session persistence and `tpm` (tmux plugin manager) for easy plugin management. 🧩
