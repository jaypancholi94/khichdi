# Turborepo
Managing a monorepo? Bold choice! Instead of handling a circus of [repos](Terminology.md#Repo), you've chosen the streamlined path with [Turborepo](https://turbo.build). It's the ultimate multitasker, ensuring everything in your projects lands smoothly like an air traffic controller for code.
## Key Features That Make Turborepo Awesome 🤝
- **Incremental Builds:** Only rebuild what's changed. It's efficient, like doing only the laundry you need.
- **Task Orchestration:** Runs tasks in the right order, like a symphony, not a mess.
- **Caching:** Speeds up CI/CD with smart caching. It remembers, so you don't have to.
- **Parallel Execution:** Run multiple tasks at once. Multitasking that actually works.
## Setting Up Turborepo: Easy Peasy 🎯
Setting up Turborepo is a breeze. A few commands, some configuration, and you're set. Whether it’s a fresh project or an existing one, the setup is painless.
:::code-group
``` bash[npm]
npx create-turbo@latest
```
```bash[yarn]
yarn dlx create-turbo@latest
```
```bash[pnpm]

```

## Structuring Your Monorepo: Order in the Chaos 🐱
Organise your monorepo with clear directories for apps and packages. 
```
/ ── root-directory
│    ├── package.json
│    ├── turbo.json
│    └── .gitignore
├── apps
│    ├── api
│    └── web
├── packages
│    ├── consts
│    ├── types
│    └── components
└── tools
     └── // Custom scripts and configurations
```

## Unified Development Experience: TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Storybook, and More
Integrating multiple tools with Turborepo creates a streamlined and consistent development experience. Here's how each tool enhances your monorepo setup:

- **[[TypeScript]]:** Centralize and share type definitions across all projects, ensuring consistency and reducing errors.
- **[[Tailwind]] CSS:** Manage and reuse style configurations across multiple applications, keeping your design consistent.
- **[[Storybook]]:** Set up and maintain a unified Storybook for all components, making it easy to develop, document, and test UI elements in isolation.
- **[[ESLint]]:** Apply consistent coding standards across all projects by setting up shared linting rules, ensuring code quality and reducing technical debt.
- **Constants:** Share values like API endpoints or magic numbers in one place to keep your code [DRY](Terminology.md#DRY).
