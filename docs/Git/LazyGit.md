# LazyGit ðŸ’¤
Another lazy setup for [[Git]]! If youâ€™re someone who absolutely _detests_ typing out Git commands (because who doesnâ€™t love a good shortcut?), this app is practically made for you. ðŸŽ‰ðŸ˜… Itâ€™s super simple to useâ€”because, really, who has time for complexity?
##  ðŸ’¡Features
- **Terminal-Based UI**: LazyGit offers a terminal-based user interface that is both intuitive and visually pleasing.
- **Simplified Git Commands**: It simplifies various Git commands into single-keypress actions, speeding up your development workflow.
- **Interactive Staging**: Stage or unstage changes interactively, with an easy-to-navigate view for selecting changes to include in a commit.
- **Branch Management**: Create, checkout, and delete branches directly from the interface with ease.
- **Commit History and Logs**: View and interact with commit history and logs right in the terminal.
## ðŸ›  Installation
```zsh
brew install lazygit
```

## ðŸ“˜ How to
Using lazygit is pretty straight forward. Here are a few common commands that I use often.
- `space`Â toggles the selected file to the staging area
- `c`Â opens the commit window, which lets you write a commit message and commit the staged changes
- `P`Â pushes the current branch to the remote
- `p` pull the remote to current branch
There are many more commands including branch management, interacting with history, and more can be found by pressing `?`.
